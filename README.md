# Youtube Subscription Organizer

## What is this?

This is a chrome extension that modifies the **subscriptions** tab of Youtube's
left navigation pane. Add collapsible div to categorize your subs.

## Why?

I have few hobbies/interests. They include programming(Go, Rust, JS/TS, Elixir, HTML/CSS, Algorithms), guitar music and gears, games, streamers and podcasts. It takes about 3 flicks of the scroll wheel to get from the top of the navigation pane to the bottom. So, I wanted to make it so that I can group the subscriptions and encase them inside a collapsible so that I can only view what I want to view.

## To do

- [x] Expand **Subscriptions** tab on navigation
- [ ] Create Collapsibles
- [ ] Move the subscriptions inside the Collapsible
- [ ] Store the data
- [ ] Initialize the Collapsible on navigation
- [ ] More
